Types of data
================

**Past land deals and acquisitions**

LandMatrix has basically everything about previous land acquisitions (.csv, .xml , .xls)

[https://landmatrix.org/en/get-the-detail/database.csv/?download\_format=csv](https://landmatrix.org/en/get-the-detail/database.csv/?download_format=csv)

Give information about target country and specifically targeted region and investor country and the reason of the grabbing ( farming, crops, mining etc etc)

Comments from:

&quot;Large scale foreign acquisitions of land in developing countries. Risks, opportunities and new actors&quot;

- Land grabbing is concentrated into specific target and origin countries
- In mainly for agriculture (67%  \&lt;- mostly for biofuels) and forests (20%)
- Developing countries are most commonly involved in land grabbing
- The number of deals that are needed for a specific region varies per origin country (Figure 2,3)
- South-South deals becoming increasingly common
- private-public partnerships has increased
- In host countries, governments are often engaged in negotiating investment deals
-  there is an increase in the share of production of basic foods

**Geocoding**

Retrieve a lat/long from an address. Or reverse, retrieve an address from a lat/long pair.

\*in python: [https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/geospatial-data-python](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/geospatial-data-python)

**Land Cover Classifications**

Used to describe land use. Is a specific location water/dry land/forest/agricultural land/urban land etc. Also can be used to describe how this land changes in recent years.
